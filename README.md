# hello-world
just another repository

Okay,

I finally am using this whole github thing. I think I understand why it's useful but I haven't explored the full extent of what is possible yet. I am not sure what I will need to do in order to get to the point where I am fully capable of making something super cool, but I don't think that i am too far away. Maybe four or five months of diligent work.
